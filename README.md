# Smart Work API
## ⚠️ARCHIVED PROJECT

**This is an archived project from my bootcamp with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) in 2023, kept for historical reference. It does not represent my current skill level or tech stack.**

Smart Work is a project manager app built using the Javascript React framework. The app uses an API created with the Django-Rest Framework to load, create, edit, and delete data. The purpose of the site is to collaborate on projects with colleagues or friends, where users can add, update and delete tasks from projects, as well as view users' profiles and customize their own. The app is split into two separate sites. This repository is the back-end API section of the app.

### Validation Testing 
All .py files pass through the [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) with no issues.
## Credits
### Content
The site was built with inspiration from the Code Institute Moments and Django Rest Framework walkthrough projects. Several models have been created with the walkthrough projects as source material, however, custom code was required to deal with deviations in the site functionality and database schema.
### Other programs used
- [https://dbdiagram.io/home](https://dbdiagram.io/home) was used to create the database schema diagram.
