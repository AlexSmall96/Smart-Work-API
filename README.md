# Smart Work
Smart Work is a project manager app built using the Javascript React framework. The app uses an API created with the Django-Rest Framework to load, create, edit, and delete data. The purpose of the site is to collaborate on projects with colleagues or friends, where users can add, update and delete tasks from projects, as well as view users' profiles and customize their own. The app is split into two seperate sites. This repository is the back end API section of the app.

### Validation Testing 
All .py files pass through the [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) with no issues.
## Deployment
### Deploying the Site to Heroku

### Forking the Repository on GitHub
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. Select an owner for the forked repository.
4. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
5. Optionally, add a description of your fork.
6. Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.
7. Click Create Fork.
### Cloning the Repository on GitHub
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click Code.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. Open Terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
